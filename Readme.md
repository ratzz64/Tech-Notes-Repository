# 📝 Tech Notes Repository

Welcome to my personal notes repository! 🚀  
Here, I document and organize my learnings, explanations and research on various electronics and embedded systems topics — from communication protocols to sensors and beyond.


## 🛠️ Why This Exists

I created this repo to:

- Serve as a personal knowledge base
- Help others looking for concise and practical explanations
- Track my learning journey in embedded systems and electronics

## 📦 Structure

Notes are organized by topic in separate markdown files for easy navigation and contribution.
